# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
This game usually is used as an initial project in the A.I. courses. I implemented two kinds of A.I. for the game. I designed the first A.I. based on the minimax algorithm. And the second A.I. is more interesting, I applied the Q-Learning algorithm, which is a reinforcement learning strategy, to evaluate the state. After the program assessing the record of the game between two random players, I used the data to train the neural network. Finally, the neural network can play the game. Although it is hard to compete with the exhaustive attack method, it shows a significant advantage over the random player.
